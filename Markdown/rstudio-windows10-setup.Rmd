# Introduction

This is a very rough and unofficial guide for setting up **R** and **RStudio** on a Windows 10 machine. The aim is to ensure as much functionality as possible, e.g., being able to install packages from source. 

All software, version numbers and links were last referenced on 2018-06-07. The below combination of software and version numbers works reasonably well. Update the software versions at your own risk!

# Neccessary Software

The following is a list of the neccessary **software** components to download. This is based on the official [**R** project recommendations](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/Rtools.txt). Note that the *version* numbers are highly likely to change frequently. 

* [**R**](https://cloud.r-project.org/index.html) *3.5.0*: <https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-3.5.0-win.exe>

* [**Rtools**](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) *3.5*: <https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/Rtools35.exe>

* [**MiKTeX**](https://miktex.org/) *2.9.6643*: <https://miktex.org/download/ctan/systems/win32/miktex/setup/windows-x64/basic-miktex-2.9.6643-x64.exe>

* [**Inno Setup**](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) *5.5.9*: <http://www.jrsoftware.org/download.php/is.exe>

* [**Strawberry Perl**](http://strawberryperl.com/) *5.26.2.1*: <http://strawberryperl.com/download/5.26.2.1/strawberry-perl-5.26.2.1-64bit.msi>

* [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) *1.1.453*: <https://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-1.1.453.exe>

# Installation procedure

<span style="color:red">**Make sure to install all software with administrator privileges! You can do so by right-clicking on the file and choose "Run as administrator". If you do not install software with administrator privileges, the installation will either fail or corrupt the functionality of R. You have been warned.**</span>

## Installation order

Instead of installing the different software randomly, it is preferable to install the software in the following order (which is not-so-coincidentally the same order as above):

1) **R**

2) **Rtools**

3) **MiKTeX**

4) **Inno Setup**

5) **Strawberry Perl**

6) **RStudio**

## Install **R**

Install R using all default parameters. 

## Install **Rtools**

Install Rtools with all additional components and link in your users environment. 

## Install **MiKTeX**, **Inno Setup** and **Strawberry Perl**

## Install **RStudio**

# Adjust your accounts environment variables

Per default, **R**s System Library is installed in `C:\Program Files\R\R-3.5.0\library`. Here, all essential *base* packages are located. For additional packages, it is advisable to setup a User Library, e.g., at `C:\Users\[your user name]\R\R-3.5.0\library`. However, R does usually not automatically identify your library locations; that's where `R_LIBS` and `R_LIBS_USER` come into play.

## `R_LIBS`: **R**s System Library

## `R_LIBS_USER`: **R**s (and your) User Library
